### 🤝 Open Source

This boilerplate is open for everyone — built by [Andi Grether](https://webworker.me) to help developers build faster,
cleaner, and more maintainable Craft CMS sites.

## ⚙️ Quick Start

Get up and running with **CraftCMS Lazy** in just a few steps.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/andee-grether/craftcms-lazy-starter-kit.git
cd craftcms-lazy-starter-kit

# Copy the environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Start DDEV and install dependencies
ddev start
ddev composer install
ddev npm install

# Import the included demo database
ddev import-db --file=demo.sql

# Admin Login
User: admin  
Password: superuser
```

Then open your site at: 👉 https://craftcms-lazy.ddev.site

---

💡 If you don’t import the demo database, you’ll start with a clean _Craft CMS Lazy_ installation.

```
ddev craft install
```

### 🧰 Development

Start the local dev server with Vite:

```bash
ddev node run dev
```

### 🏗️ Production Build

When you’re ready to build the production assets:

```bash
ddev node run build
```

This will generate the optimized files in the web/dist/ directory and update the manifest.json for Craft’s Vite
integration.

### 🖼️ Demo Assets

This repo includes `/uploads` in version control so the starter kit works out of the box.  
In production, these should be added to `.gitignore`.
